# UTF-8 Kannada Text Encoding – Internship Task

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates how to handle and analyze **Kannada text** using **Unicode** and **UTF-8 encoding** in Python. It prints a Kannada paragraph and shows each character's Unicode code point and UTF-8 byte sequence.

## 📝 Kannada Paragraph Used
```
ನಮಸ್ಕಾರ ಗೆಳೆಯರೆ!
ನಾನು ಕನ್ನಡ ಭಾಷೆ ಓದುತ್ತೇನೆ.
ಇದು ನನ್ನ ಪ್ರಿಯ ಭಾಷೆ.
ನಮಗೆ ಕನ್ನಡ ತುಂಬಾ ಪ್ರೀತಿಯದ್ದು.
```

## 🧠 Purpose
To learn how regional language characters are stored and encoded in digital systems using standard encoding formats like UTF-8.

## 🛠️ Files Included
- `kannada_paragraph_utf.py` – Python script to display the paragraph and its character encoding details.
- `kannada_utf8.txt` – Kannada paragraph saved in UTF-8 format.
- `README.md` – This file (documentation for the project).

## ▶️ How to Run
Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Then run:

```bash
python kannada_paragraph_utf.py
```

## ✅ Output
The script will:
- Print the Kannada paragraph.
- Show each character's:
  - Unicode code point (e.g., U+0CA8)
  - UTF-8 bytes (e.g., E0 B2 A8)

## 📚 Learning Outcome
This task provides practical experience in handling Indian language text using Unicode and UTF-8, which is essential for multilingual support in modern software and embedded systems.
